# cra-docker

Create statically built Create React App applications docker images for easy deployment with environment variables support at runtime.

This project was created to solve known problem with CRA in favor of 12 factor apps.
See https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2353

## Usage

All you need to do is get the content of built app (`build` folder) inside docker image in `/app` folder.

To get this working firstly create `Dockerfile` in your project root with content:

```
FROM inloopx/cra-docker

COPY build /app
```

then you can call:

```
# or npm run build
yarn build
docker build -t my-new-app .
```

Once the build is done, you should have your image ready. To verify it, run the image bind to 8080 port:

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 my-new-app
```

Now if you open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) You should see your app.

You can find more in [example](example) directory. Also if you use gitlab, don't miss the [pipeline configuration file example](example/.gitlab-ci.yml)

docker build -t sa1i/cra-docker:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) .;docker push sa1i/cra-docker:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
